# 42 Cursus get_next_line

Extract from the Project Subject :

" The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line,
read from a file descriptor. 
This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables. "
